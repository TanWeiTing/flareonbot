# flareonbot
Just something I wanna work on

I don't really know what to put here so I'm just going to give you a rundown on this

First of all you can do literally anything with my code, make it better, make it worse (don't actually), just do anything with it. Make it interesting
Secondly, this is a passion project that I just want to have fun making, if you can contribute you absolutely can! I appreciate it.
Thirdly, just don't do anything stupid with this bot

So that should be about it for this short readme, as I've said before I don't know how to write a readme if there is any improvements to be made you can do that.
